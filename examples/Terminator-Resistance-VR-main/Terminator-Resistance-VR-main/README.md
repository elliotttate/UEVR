<details>

<summary>How to downgrade to v1028 </summary>

1)  load steam console by clicking this link or pasting it into start, run box: 
```
steam://nav/console
```
2)  In the steam client on the console tab, paste this command in the console line at the bottom and hit enter: 
```
download_depot 954740 954741 6319668420982262798
```
3)  There's no progress bar, but it will say it's downloading and also tell you when it's done and where it put the files. Will look like this: 

    > download_depot 954740 954741 6319668420982262798
    
    > Downloading depot 954741 (10808 MB) ...
    
    > Depot download complete : "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_954740\depot_954741" (43 files, manifest 6319668420982262798) 

5)  Go to your game files by finding your game, right click and hover on manage, then "browse local files" 

6)  This puts you somewhere like SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Terminator Resistance 

7)  Delete all these files and copy the downloaded files from the location the console gave you "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_954740\depot_954741" into the now empty folder. 

8)  When you're done, steam wont even know you downgraded. Play the game normally.

# IMPORTANT
## The following UEVR settings are controlled by the Mod
- Aim Method
- D-Pad Shifting Method
- DecoupledPitchUIAdjust
- UI Distance
- UI Size
- CameraUpOffset
- CameraForwardOffset
- CameraRightOffset
----



## Controls
- No change to game controls
- If using the Crosshair mod, will appear when you aim
- Left Thumb-Stick switches to D-Pad for menu's/Inventory
- Optional plugin for Index Controllers by Markmon

    (Below is for folks who don't want to click their Thumb-Sticks) 

- Sprint mapped to Right Thumb-Stick ↑ 
- Ultra-Vision/Camera mapped to Right Thumb-Stick ↓
----



## Weapon Wheel
1. Hold your Left Grip to open the Weapon Wheel
2. Select weapon with Right Stick

    While the Weapon Wheel is open, ..  

    Left Thumb-Stick switches to a D-Pad, allowing you to select: 

- ↓ Flashlight (hold for 1 second)
- ↑ Inventory
- Change ← Offensive | Defensive →

    This also works when at the Shelter and Hideout (when the weapon wheel does NOT show) so you can enable flashlight or open inventory. 
----



## Camera Control (NOT UltraVision)
1. Hold Right Stick ↑ While the Camera is Enabled

    While holding Right Stick ↑, Use: 

- Left Stick ←  = Decrease zoom
- Left Stick →  = Increase zoom

    (View will NOT change, you will hear a Click to signify zoom was clicked)
  
    Once you let go of the Right Stick, you can move around normally. 
----



## Melee Gesture
- Swing your Right Controller in ANY direction
- Stop your Right Controller pointing at the object/enemy you wish to hit
- Melee will trigger
####  (In game Melee (Y button) still works as intended)

## Important Notes / FAQ's
:question: _My Loading or "Press to Continue" screen is blank_

:bulb: Bug due to UEVR being UN-responsive during loading screens in this game, just press any button to continue

---

:question: _Game is crashing and/or won't launch_

:bulb: If you used the older v1028 mod REMOVE "-nohmd" from the game's Launch Properties

---

:question: _Some cut-scenes have no subtitles_

:bulb: The UI has been removed to remove black bars from cut-scenes, this means that the subtitles for those parts are also invisible

---

:question: _Smoke/Fog only appearing in 1 eye_

:bulb: Set "Effects" to "Epic" in the Game's settings, the user_script file will take care of the rest

---

:question: _Locks/Hacking device may appear at odd angle_

:bulb: For best result, point your controller straight ahead.

---

:question: _In the Metro scene where you shoot a Terminator on the floor you lose aiming_

:bulb: Simply walk forwards until you hear Jennifer/Baron talk, aiming will return.

---

:question: _Performance_

:bulb:  Here are some graphic and performance tweaks, ..

https://gameplay.tips/guides/5903-terminator-resistance.html
